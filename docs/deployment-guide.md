# Deployment Instructions

This guide provides instructions for deploying the AWS-based DDoS-protected web application solution using the AWS Management Console. The deployment includes components like EC2 instances, Auto Scaling Groups, Application Load Balancers, AWS WAF, and AWS Shield.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following before starting the deployment:

- **An AWS account** with sufficient permissions to create EC2 instances, Auto Scaling Groups, Load Balancers, VPCs, and security services.
- **AWS Management Console Access** configured with credentials to manage resources.
- **Region Selection**: Choose a supported AWS region where the required services are available, such as:
  - **US East (N. Virginia)**
  - **US East (Ohio)**
  - **US West (Oregon)**
  - **Asia Pacific (Mumbai)**
  - **Europe (Ireland)**

### Required AWS Services

- **Amazon EC2**: For hosting instances within Auto Scaling Groups.
- **AWS WAF**: For firewall and bot control rules.
- **AWS Shield**: For DDoS protection.
- **AWS CloudWatch**: For monitoring and logging.
- **AWS Application Load Balancer**: For public and private facing load balancing.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Set Up the VPC and Subnets

1. In the AWS Management Console, navigate to **VPC** and create a new VPC with appropriate CIDR ranges.
2. Create **public subnets** across multiple Availability Zones for high availability.
3. Create **private subnets** for internal components.

### 2. Configure Security Groups

1. Set up security groups to allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic to the public-facing load balancer.
2. Configure appropriate inbound and outbound rules for EC2 instances within Auto Scaling Groups to communicate securely.

### 3. Create an Application Load Balancer

1. Go to the **EC2 Dashboard** > **Load Balancers** and create an **Application Load Balancer**.
2. Select the public subnets and set up listeners for HTTP/HTTPS.
3. Configure routing to forward requests to target groups containing your EC2 instances.

### 4. Configure Auto Scaling Groups and Launch EC2 Instances

1. In the **Auto Scaling** section, create Auto Scaling Groups for both the public and private subnets.
2. Configure the **Launch Template** with instance type, AMI, and security groups.
3. Set scaling policies to automatically scale the number of instances based on demand.

### 5. Set Up AWS WAF and Shield

1. Navigate to **AWS WAF & Shield** in the console.
2. Create a **Web ACL** in AWS WAF and set up bot control and other custom rules to filter malicious requests.
3. Attach the Web ACL to the public-facing Application Load Balancer.
4. Enable **AWS Shield Standard** for DDoS protection on the Application Load Balancer.

### 6. Configure AWS CloudWatch for Monitoring

1. Go to **CloudWatch** in the AWS Console.
2. Set up custom dashboards to monitor key metrics, such as request count, response times, and error rates.
3. Create alarms for metrics like high CPU utilization or a spike in incoming traffic.

### 7. Test the Deployment

1. Access the public URL of the Application Load Balancer to verify that the site is reachable.
2. Simulate traffic to test the Auto Scaling and AWS WAF rules.
3. Monitor CloudWatch for alerts or unusual activity that may indicate misconfigurations.

### 8. Cleanup Resources (Optional)

To avoid unexpected charges, ensure that you delete resources not in use. This includes Auto Scaling Groups, EC2 instances, Load Balancers, and any custom VPCs or subnets created specifically for this deployment.

### Additional Notes

- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: If your application interacts with other domains, configure CORS settings as needed in the Application Load Balancer or AWS WAF rules.
- **Cost Management**: AWS provides **Cost Explorer** and **Budgets** to track spending. Consider setting up a budget alert to monitor your usage.

This completes the deployment of a DDoS-protected web application using AWS. The solution leverages AWS WAF, AWS Shield, and Auto Scaling for robust security and scalability.
